# üöó Salifort Motors HR Analytics ‚Äì Capstone Project
Salifort Motors HR Analytics Capstone project using Python, Pandas, Seaborn &amp; Scikit-learn. Built models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict employee attrition (ROC-AUC 0.91) and identified overtime, job satisfaction &amp; promotions as key drivers.

This project was completed as part of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate**.  
The case study focuses on **Salifort Motors**, a large automotive company, where the goal is to analyze HR data to uncover factors contributing to **employee attrition** and provide **data-driven insights** for improving retention.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

- Provided by Google (HR dataset with employee demographics, performance, and satisfaction data)  
- Contains features such as:  
  - Employee demographics (Age, Gender, Education)  
  - Job-related info (Role, Salary, Years at Company, Promotions)  
  - Work-life balance and satisfaction scores  
  - Attrition status (Target variable)  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## üîÑ Workflow

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**  
   - Checked for missing values and inconsistencies  
   - Performed feature encoding and scaling  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of attrition across demographics  
   - Correlation between job satisfaction, overtime, and attrition  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest  
   - Gradient Boosting  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC  
   - Feature importance analysis  

5. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Work-life balance and overtime have strong correlation with attrition  
   - Employees with fewer promotions are more likely to leave  
   - Salary and job role impact retention

## üìä Key Results

- Best performing model: **Random Forest**  
- Achieved **F1-score: 0.86** and **ROC-AUC: 0.91**  
- Identified top 3 drivers of attrition: **Overtime, Job Satisfaction, and Promotions**

## ‚úçÔ∏è Project Description (for LinkedIn / Resume)

**Salifort Motors HR Analytics (Capstone Project ‚Äì Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate)**  

This project focused on analyzing HR data from **Salifort Motors** to uncover patterns driving employee attrition. Using Python, data exploration, and machine learning, I built classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict employee turnover with high accuracy.  

Key contributions:  
- Conducted **EDA** to identify attrition trends across demographics, job roles, and satisfaction levels  
- Built and compared ML models, with **Random Forest achieving an ROC-AUC of 0.91**  
- Discovered **overtime, lack of promotions, and job satisfaction** as the strongest attrition drivers  
- Recommended HR strategies to improve retention through **career development programs** and **better work-life balance policies**  

This project demonstrates **practical business analytics, predictive modeling, and data-driven decision-making** applied in an HR context.
